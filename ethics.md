## (Answer before group discussion) Scoring System Rationale  

What are your housing priority scoring criteria? Why did you choose these weights? How do they reflect the goals of fairness, privacy, simplicity, or rewarding effort? Recall that the categories are:

- Class year (1=Freshman, 2=Sophomore, 3=Junior, 4=Senior)
- Graduation status (True/False)
- Credits earned
- Additional questions - what questions did you choose?

Describe your thought process here before the group discussion.

- Add student athlete as a priority for housing. This is because they may need more room accomodations and may have earlier wake-up times due to practice schedules. Give them plus 2 points in terms of priority but they would not outclass a senior or someone with an exceptional number of credit hours earned. 

- Add terminally disabled students because they will need special accomodations to support their on campus living. For example, they may need to be assigned to a building that has elevator access as opposed to a stair only building. Considering all this, I would give them 4 priority points, outclassing as senior because of their physical demands. 



## (Answer after group discussion) Similarities and Differences

1. Describe how your scoring system is similar to at least one other system. If there are none like yours, explain why.

Response: My scoring system is similar to my tablemates system because they both use the points system to assign value to a students for their housing priority/selection. The points system considerss all the needs of the student and the availability of the room/board to appropriately assign housing. 

2. Describe how your scoring system is different from at least one other system. If everyone in your group had the same system, please state that (after checking carefully that there really are no differences).

Response: My scoring system is the same as the systems within my table group. We all rationalized that this was a fair way to assign priority for housing assignments.
